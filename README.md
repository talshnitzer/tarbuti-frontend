## Reflection

  This Project is build out of existing need in such a database from trusted user.
  The Project is meant to be used in rural local councils or organizations, were the production of cultural events is distributed among a lot of poeple.

  This is a 3 months project including a backend server.

  Project goals included using technologies I was expirianced with as well as new ones:
  I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, than adding react hooks and  `react-router-dom`. I also used `superagent` to access the server.

  One of the main challenges I ran into was grafics.
  Since there is no graphic designer to this project, I've invested time in learning about UI/UX and implement it using `Material-ui`.

  -At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, react-router-dom, React hooks, LoDash, superagent, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and MaterialUi. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
